Initial setup:
+ N nodes with predefined addresses
+ Each node opens server socket to listen for N-1 incoming connections
+ Each node connects to N-1 node (except itself)
+ On startup creates vector clock with one record [<node name, JOINING>]
+ Each node creates seen set and adds itself to it [node name]
+ During gossip round sends vector clock together with seen set

+ Each node compares its local vector clock with the remote one
	+ if both are equal add itself to remote seen set
	+ if there is a difference merge vector clocks, clean seen set abd itself to it

+ Once leader node sees N nodes in seen set(convergence) for the specified 
  time period, it changes one of the JOINIG to UP (vector clock update)

+ If converges reached and all nodes are in UP status do nothing
